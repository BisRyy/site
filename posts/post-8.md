New Skin!
==

Decided not to let my typekit account go to waste hence I changed the font of the site to the famous **Proxima Nova** and tweaked the colors slightly so that it does not look totally similar to [Chun Mun's Blog](http://chunmun.github.io/CS3216). Benefits of building [your own blogging engine](https://github.com/yangshun/luna) is that you have the flexibility to customize it in however way you want it!

Finally, a break from all the HTML and CSS coding now that all the assignments have been completed. I'm really excited at what my team is going to build for the final project. "What is it?", you ask. I don't know the answer to it myself. Now that's where the fun starts (:
