The trouble with group projects:

- Grouping with _mediocre_ teammates makes you want to do everything by yourself. You probably end up having to do so anyways and die in the process.
- Grouping with _godlike_ teammates encourages you to decide on a scope beyond the project and you guys die meeting the crazy specifications you have designed for yourself.

Group work is **hard**.
